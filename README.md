# 🦅 Market Regime & Behavioral Analytics System

### **Primetrade.ai Engineering Assignment**

**Objective:** Analyze how market sentiment (Fear/Greed) relates to trader behavior and performance on Hyperliquid. Main goal is to uncover patterns that could inform smarter trading strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project solves the **"Regime Shift" problem** in algorithmic trading. Most models fail because they assume market conditions are static. This system dynamically adjusts to **Fear** (Mean Reversion) and **Greed** (Momentum) regimes.


---

## 📂 Data Sources & Architecture

The system ingests two primary datasets to engineer **12+ composite features** (e.g., `risk_sentiment_interaction`, `aggression_score`).

| **Dataset** | **Description** | **Source Link** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bitcoin Sentiment** | Daily Fear & Greed Index (0-100). used for Regime Classification. | [Download Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PgQC0tO8XN-wqkNyghWc_-mnrYv_nhSf/view?usp=sharing) |
| **Trader History** | Tick-level trade data from Hyperliquid (Symbol, Size, Side, PnL, Leverage). | [Download Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IAfLZwu6rJzyWKgBToqwSmmVYU6VbjVs/view?usp=sharing) |

**Pipeline Architecture:**

`Raw Data` $\rightarrow$ `Cleaning (Nulls/Outliers)` $\rightarrow$ `Feature Engineering (Rolling Windows)` $\rightarrow$ `Modeling (RF/K-Means)` $\rightarrow$ `Dashboard (Streamlit)`

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Environment Setup

Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** installed.
Clone the repository and install all required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd market-regime-analytics

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2️⃣ Running the Dashboard (The “Command Center”)

Launch the interactive Streamlit application .

```bash
streamlit run dashboard_app.py
```

📍 Opens automatically in your browser at:
**[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)**

---

### 3️⃣ Reproducing the Analysis (Notebooks)

Run the notebooks **in order** to fully regenerate data artifacts and models:

1. `notebooks/01_data_prep.ipynb`
   → Cleans and validates raw CSV datasets.

2. `notebooks/02_feature_engineering.ipynb`
   → Creates sentiment-behavior interaction features.

3. `notebooks/03_analysis.ipynb`
   → Exploratory analysis and validation of “Golden Rules”.

4. `notebooks/04_modeling.ipynb`
   → Trains **Random Forest** (supervised) and **K-Means** (unsupervised) models.
